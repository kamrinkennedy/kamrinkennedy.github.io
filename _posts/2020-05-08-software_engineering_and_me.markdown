Hello, there. My name is Kamrin Kennedy. I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana. I attended Louisiana State University and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Theatre Performance in 2013 to fulfill my dream of becoming an actor.

Not unlike many who attend to the same dreams, I settled into working in restaurants. While my career in the service industry has introduced me to many life-long friends and taught me several invaluable lessons, I've come to the point in my life where it's time for a change in pace.

This is what brings us here today. A software engineering career path has sparked my attention for several reasons:

* Potential for upward mobility
* Ability to continuously learn new things in an ever-growning field
* Possibilities for remote work / availability to work from many different locations
* Combination of artistic and analytical/logical skills

Coming from an artistic background, software engineering is something that excites me in a unique way. I am extremely enticed by an SE's ability to construct something magical from the ground up with there being no one, absolutely correct method of getting it done. In that regard, it's not quite so different from what I've studied in my theatrical background. I'm extremely excited to begin this journey, and I cannot wait to see what incredible things I will be able to learn and do in my time here.
